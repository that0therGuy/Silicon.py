# 🔍 Info

## General:

Silicon.py aims to deliver **true sandbox coding experience** for
students, researchers and anyone who would like to experiment and tinker
with code.

Major strengths of using Silicon.py include having **multiple library
support, aesthetics, a heavenly coding experience and Challenge Packs**.

I hope you enjoy my product. Thanks and have fun coding! 🤩

Project last updated on **22/1/26**

## Code Editor:

Click inside the editor and press **F10** to make editor go
**fullscreen.**

Either use **F5** or press or the header to run your code. **Code is
saved after it runs.**

Use **CTRL + Left Click** for **multi-cursor editing.**

numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, sympy, scikit-learn, statsmodels,
numba, matplotlib, bokeh, seaborn, biopython, rdkit, pyodide-py, lxml,
pyyaml, dateutil, pytz, httpx, requests, websockets, scikit-learn,
xgboost, micropip, pytest, setuptools support inbuilt.

You can swipe numbers to increase/decrease and booleans are toggle-able
by clicking. These are the beta-features.

**Top of the line AI (gpt-5.2-codex)** is integrated within the
application. Use it **(for free!)** to your advantage to generate and
understand code.

## Challenge Packs:

Challenge packs aim to deliver a Leetcode inspired challenge system
EXCEPT that challenge packs are decentralized, which means that anybody
can create these packs and share each other as JSON files.

Still working on online functionality where users can post these packs
in the application itself instead of sharing the JSON files with each
other on different platforms.

A challenge pack looks like this:

![Challenge Pack Example](Screenshot_1.png)

The JSON file should contain author key and questions 1, 2, 3 in form of
q1,q2,q3.

In each q(number) object, there should be a question key that narrates
the problem, the sample which contains the input that the app will test
the user's code on and output which should be the answer to each sample.

Challenge Packs are still not finished and you may encounter bugs.
